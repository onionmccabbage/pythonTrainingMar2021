Python Review 2   see https://pastebin.com/amT1vD9v
===============   about 1 hr
Write a new module which asks the user for a 'category' and an 'id' (remember to use input() for this)
- The category may be any one of 'users', 'posts, 'albums' or 'photos'
- The id must be a positive integer in the range 1-8
After you ask the user for category and id values, build a string something like this: 
- 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/{}/{}'
Use .format() to inject the 'category' and 'id' into the curly brackets

Use the 'requests' library to make a 'get' call to this end-point API
Use json.dumps() to convert the returned dict to a string
Append this string to a text file

Make use of functions as you see fit

Optional
========
Write try-except blocks around some of your code (e.g. the api access and also the file writer)
We need to ensure these two parameters are in the required form:
Write a function called 'cleanup' which receives positional or keyword arguments (as you see fit)
However you pass the arguments, the cleanup function should ensure:
- there is a value for the 'category' as a non-empty string containing one of the permitted categories
- there is a value for the 'id' as an integer in the range 1-8 inclusive
If category or id is missing or unacceptable, you should provide sensible defaults
 (or, for example, if id is a floating point number or a string, try to cast it as an int() )
Use your 'cleanup' function to sanitize the user-provided data

Write another function which will read back as many lines as the user asks for from the text file
Force the 'category' text to lower-case text using category.lower()
